# mno_navigator_flutter

A Flutter "publication navigator" freely inspired by
the [Readium 2 Naavigator](https://readium.org/technical/r2-navigator-architecture/).

## Note

While it is inspired by the platform-specific implementations provided by Readium 2, this Flutter implementation makes a
few different choices. One of the main differences is the pagination and page-turn implementation strategies.
